# ChatApp_Docker  
A fully containerized real-time chat application built for seamless deployment, easy scalability, and modular architecture.  

This project is a complete solution for building and deploying a chat application using modern technologies and containerization with Docker. It includes all necessary configurations to run the application locally or in a production environment.  

---

## Key Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Enables instant communication using WebSockets.  
- **Fully Dockerized**: All components, including the frontend, backend, and signaling server, are containerized and orchestrated using Docker Compose.  
- **Modular architecture**: The project is structured into separate services, making it easy to maintain and extend.  
- **Scalable and production-ready**: Built with scalability in mind, the application can handle increased loads seamlessly.  
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works across various operating systems and environments.

## Project Structure  

The repository is organized as follows:  

```plaintext  
ChatApp_Docker/  
├── client/             # Frontend application (React or vanilla JavaScript)  
├── server/             # Backend application (Node.js + Express.js)  
├── signaling-server/   # Signaling server for WebRTC connections  
├── docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose configuration to orchestrate all services  
└── README.md           # Project documentation  
```  

Each component is containerized and works together to provide a seamless user experience.

## Prerequisites  

To get started, ensure you have the following tools installed:  

- **Docker**: Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to run containers.  
- **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository.  

---

## Quick Start  

Follow these steps to launch the chat application:  

1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/AbdoElboshy/ChatApp_Docker.git  
   cd ChatApp_Docker  
   ```  

2. Build and start the Docker containers:  

   ```bash  
   docker-compose up --build  
   ```  

   Once the process completes, all services will be up and running.  

3. Access the services in your browser:  

   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`  
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`  
   - Signaling Server: `http://localhost:5001`  

4. To stop all services when you're done:  

   ```bash  
   docker-compose down  
   ```

## Built With  

This project utilizes the following technologies:  

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.  
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for the server.  
- **Socket.io**: Handles real-time WebSocket communication.  
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization and orchestration.  
- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer communication via the signaling server.
